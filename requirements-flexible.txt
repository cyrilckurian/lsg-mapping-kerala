# Alternative dependencies that work better with Python 3.14
# Use this if the regular requirements.txt fails

# Core geospatial libraries (try without versions first)
geopandas
pandas
shapely
fiona
pyproj

# Web scraping
requests
beautifulsoup4

# Note: If installation still fails with Python 3.14, you need to:
# 1. Use Python 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 instead
# 2. Or wait for pandas/geopandas to release Python 3.14 compatible versions
